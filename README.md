# WeatherDataHtmlCss

Note that this code is not complete.
The Arduino code is missing and unfortunately disappeared into the folder and file jungle.

But here is the html and css code!

This project was using openweathermap.com's API.
When you click on the "Stockholm" button, the current weather should be displayed on the website and so on.

The Arduino part was that depending on what kind of weather we got in from the API, if it was sun / rain / clouds / wind 
then a dot matrix display would show an animation of a sun / rain etc ..

(I'll try to find that code)

Hope you enjoy!
